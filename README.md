## implementation
- Before drawing click on draw button, then add points to the ground and when you want to close the polygon just put the last point close to the first point, then give a right click to complete the shape.
- Before drawing your next shape you have to extrude the shape with the extrude button being enabled.
- Then you can drag the 3d model by clicking on move button
- You can manipulate vertices by clicking on vertex edit button so that all the editable vertices will be shown and you can manipulate the mesh with mouse interactions.
